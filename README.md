# Classic Lateral Thinking Puzzles Collection

## Project Introduction

Lateral Thinking Puzzles (also known as "Turtle Soup" in some Asian regions) are situational reasoning games that originated from Western lateral thinking challenges. The name "Turtle Soup" comes from a classic puzzle: A man orders turtle soup at a restaurant, takes one sip, then goes home and commits suicide. Why?

## Game Rules

- The puzzle presenter provides a seemingly illogical or confusing situation (the "surface")
- Players can only ask yes/no questions
- The presenter can only answer "yes," "no," or "irrelevant"
- Through continuous questioning, players need to deduce the complete truth behind the story (the "solution")

## Historical Background

These puzzles are formally known as "Situation Puzzles" or "Lateral Thinking Puzzles," first introduced by Dr. Edward de Bono, an Oxford University psychology professor, in 1967. They are known as "Turtle Soup" in some Asian regions and "Git Mei Gu" in Hong Kong.
